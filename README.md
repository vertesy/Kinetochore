### Abstract

> The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures proper chromosome segregation by monitoring kinetochore-microtubule interactions. SAC proteins are shed from kinetochores once attachments are achieved. Human kinetochores consist of hundreds of SAC protein recruitment modules and bind up to 20 microtubules, raising the question how the SAC responds to intermediate attachment states. We show that the ‘RZZS-MAD1/2’ module of the SAC is fully removed from kinetochores at low microtubule occupancy and remains absent at higher states, while the ‘BUB1/R1’ module is retained at substantial levels irrespective of occupancy. Artificially tuning the afinity of kinetochores for microtubules further shows that ~50% occupancy is sufficient to silence the SAC. The human kinetochore thus responds as a single unit to shut down SAC signaling at submaximal occupancy states, but retains one SAC module. This may ensure continued SAC silencing on kinetochores with fluctuating occupancy states while maintaining the ability for fast SAC re-activation if needed.
